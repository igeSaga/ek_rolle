# Energy Concept for the Municipalities Rolle and Mont-Sur-Rolle

The goal of this project is to develope an energy concept for the two municipalities Rolle and Mont-Sur-Rolle. An important building block of the concept is a database consisting of all buildings with associated information on size, volume, heating system and, finally, an assumption for the total energy consuption.

## Getting Started

The respository contains all R files, required for the computational part of the analysis. The following R markdown files are contained:

- rolle_buildings.RMD: The script covers all steps from reading in geometries of buildings, to the intersection of buildings with relevant metadata and, finally, the computation of a homogenized set of buildings that can be used in all follow up analysis.
